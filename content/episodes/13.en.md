## Description 
What happens when we combine computer science with biology? In this episode, we chat with Adzkia Salima, a software engineer with background in computer science in bioinformatics. We learn so much about bioinformatics, from computer science concepts that you usually use in bioinformatics, how bioinformatics help advance processes that otherwise would take months or even years, to the potential of bioinformatics and agriculture tech especially in Indonesia.
